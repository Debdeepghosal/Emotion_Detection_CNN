# Emotion Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 🎭

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting emotions in images using deep learning techniques.

## Overview ℹ️

Emotion Detection CNN is built to recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and more in facial images. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled facial expressions, enabling it to classify emotions accurately.

## Features ✨

- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks for image-based emotion detection
- Trained on a labeled dataset for recognizing various facial expressions
- Allows inference on images to predict emotions depicted in them

## Dataset 📁

The model is trained on a dataset comprising facial images annotated with respective emotions. You can find more details about the dataset used and its sources in the `data/` directory or in the project documentation.

## Requirements 🛠️

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage 🚀

1. **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
